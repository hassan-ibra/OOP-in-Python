What is Object-Oriented Programming?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code that manipulate the data. OOP is a popular programming paradigm for creating reusable, modular, and scalable software.

Principles of Object-Oriented Programming
There are four main principles of object-oriented programming:

Encapsulation: The process of hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary interfaces to the outside world.
Inheritance: The process of creating new classes from existing classes, inheriting the properties and behaviors of the parent class.
Polymorphism: The process of using a single interface to represent multiple types of objects.
Abstraction: The process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.
Classes and Objects
In OOP, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that an object will have. An object is an instance of a class that contains its own data and behavior.

Inheritance
Inheritance is a powerful feature of OOP that allows you to create new classes from existing ones. The new class inherits the properties and methods of the parent class and can add new properties and methods of its own.

Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows you to use a single interface to represent multiple types of objects. This makes it easy to write code that works with different types of objects without having to know their specific implementations.

Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary interfaces to the outside world. This helps to prevent the code from being modified by other parts of the program.

Conclusion
Object-oriented programming is a powerful programming paradigm that allows you to create reusable, modular, and scalable software. By understanding the principles of OOP and applying them in practice, you can create software that is easier to maintain and extend. This repository contains educational materials that will help you learn the fundamentals of OOP and apply them in practice.
